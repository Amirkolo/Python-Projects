## Currency Converter Module

This module provides functionalities to fetch real-time exchange rates and perform currency conversion. It includes the following functions:

1. **get_exchange_rates:**  
   Fetches real-time exchange rates for a base currency against various target currencies using a generic API provider. The default base currency is USD.

2. **convert_currency:**  
   Converts an amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates retrieved through the `get_exchange_rates` function.

3. **main:**  
   Prompts the user for currency conversion by taking input for the currency they have and the currency they want. It then retrieves real-time rates, performs the conversion, and displays the result with timestamps.

### Usage:

To use the Currency Converter module, follow these steps:

1. Run the `main` function.
2. Enter the currency you have (e.g., USD, EUR, JPY).
3. Enter the currency you want to convert to (e.g., USD, EUR, JPY).
4. Input the amount you want to convert.
5. The program will display the converted amount along with the timestamp of when the exchange rates were retrieved.
6. You can choose to convert again or exit the program.

### Dependencies:

This module requires the following dependencies:
- `requests`: To make HTTP requests to the exchange rate API.
- `datetime`: To handle timestamps for displaying exchange rate retrieval times.

### Notes:

- The exchange rates are fetched from a generic API provider, which may have limitations or rate limits. Consider exploring other options for broader coverage.
- This module serves as a basic currency converter and may not cover all edge cases or provide precise real-time rates due to API limitations.
